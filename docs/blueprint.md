# **App Name**: Latent Sculptor

## Core Features:

- Node Canvas: Interactive Canvas: A workspace where users can manipulate Nodes representing various generative parameters.
- Parameter Nodes: Tangible Parameter Nodes: Visual representations of text prompts, pixel manipulations (noise, brightness, color), and model settings (diffusion strength, seed) that can be moved and connected on the canvas.
- Influence Mapping: Spatialized Influence: The position of a Node on the canvas (e.g., vertical axis) dictates its influence on the final output.
- Pipeline Visualization: Visible Signal Flow: A live, continuous visualization of the data pipeline: Input Image -> Pixel Manipulations -> Generative Model Input -> Final Output. 
- Meta-Nodes: Grouping: Users can group a collection of nodes into meta-nodes.
- Parameter Guidance: Guidance Tool: Utilize an AI to recommend parameter adjustments, which the user may accept or reject. The recommendations help new users to efficiently discover complex emergent relationships

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of depth and the exploration of the unknown.
- Background color: Dark gray (#303030) for a professional and focused atmosphere, helping the interactive elements stand out.
- Accent color: Bright green (#4CAF50) as an accent to highlight interactive elements and indicate real-time updates.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, will be used throughout the interface for its modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for both headlines and body text
- Minimalist icons for Nodes and actions to keep the interface clean and intuitive.
- Canvas-centric layout, emphasizing the interactive space with controls arranged around it.
- Subtle animations to indicate the flow of data and the impact of Node manipulations in real-time.
